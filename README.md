### Hi there. I'm Shai👋

- 🔭 I love math, programming, data science, running, and playing the Trombone and the Piano.
- 🌱 I love to learn each and every day.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on cool data science projects. 
- 🌍 I'm sharing a little bit of my knowledge here on Github, on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shainis) and on [my blog](https://shainis.quarto.pub).
- ⚡ Fun fact: I used to be a professional Trombone player in a symphony orchestra, and nowadays I play in a small hollidays-band in my Kibutz.
- 📑 Another fun fact: I have a Ph.D in history. Why? Becuase I just love it! 😊
